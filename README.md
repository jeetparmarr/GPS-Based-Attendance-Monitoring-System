# GPS-Based-Attendance-Monitoring-System
This is a web-based system that allows users (e.g., students or employees) to log in securely and mark their attendance using their current GPS location. It fetches the user's longitude and latitude, converts it into a human-readable address using the HERE Maps API, and stores the data in a MySQL database.
